Simple encrypted file transfer

This was code written for a graduate level network security class.
It was a fun project so I am archiving it.  That being said, I wouldn't
use this code in the wild.  I believe there are a couple bugs that
would need to be addressed before it is actually secure.  Having written
more code since then, there are many things I would do a little differently.
